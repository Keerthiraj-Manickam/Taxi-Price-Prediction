# Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to solve a specific problem. The goal is to build predictive models that analyze the dataset and provide meaningful insights or accurate predictions. The entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is covered.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Not explicitly mentioned in the notebook. Please provide the source if available.
- **Description**: The dataset's description wasn't directly available. It appears to have been used for regression tasks.
- **Key Features**: Feature details weren't specified in markdown; likely defined in preprocessing sections.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Imported necessary libraries.
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial inspection.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Applied feature engineering where necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Insights from EDA were not explicitly documented in the notebook.
   - Suggested EDA insights could include:
     - Relationships between key features and the target variable.
     - Distribution of data or any outlier observations.

3. **Model Building**
   - **Linear Regression (Ridge and Lasso Regularization)**:
     - Best Ridge Parameters: `{'alpha': 0.001}`
     - Best Ridge Score: `-491.101`
     - Evaluation:
       - R²: ~0.34
       - MAE: ~17.53
       - MSE: ~480.78

   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
     - Best Parameters: `{'metric': 'euclidean', 'n_neighbors': 11}`
     - Best Score: `397.32`
     - Evaluation:
       - R²: ~0.54
       - MAE: ~16.14
       - MSE: ~385.53

   - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:
     - Best Parameters: `{'C': 35, 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'rbf'}`
     - Best Score: `389.74`
     - Evaluation:
       - R²: ~0.56
       - MAE: ~15.64
       - MSE: ~363.50

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE (if applicable).
   - Compared the results of different models to select the best-performing one.

5. **Conclusion and Insights**
   - Summarized key findings.
   - Provided recommendations or actionable insights based on the results.
